# MM7150
a library for Microchip Motion Sensor Fusion module.
The MM7150 it's a standalone module with a Bosch BMC150 Geomagnetic Sensor/Accelerometer, a Bosch BMG160 Gyroscope and a 32-bit Embedded Controller with all firmware needed to expose 9Axis data trough 400Khz I2C.
The coprocessor has background calibration and uses last fusion filters, gyro drift cancellation, magnetic compensation and much more, plus the ability to expose sensor RAW data for additional filtering.
